# 🗜️ Huffman Coding (In Progress)

This library is designed to make **Huffman coding** easy to use, while providing 
optimized and reusable utilities. It aims to simplify the integration of Huffman 
coding into projects, improve maintainability, and ensure robust testing.

Huffman coding is a cornerstone of many compression algorithms and formats, widely used in:
	•	🖼️ Images: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF.
	•	🎥 Video: MPEG, H.264, HEVC (H.265).
	•	🎵 Audio: MP3, AAC, Opus.
	•	📦 Compression: ZIP, DEFLATE, Brotli.
	•	🔗 Networking: HTTP/2, HTTP/3 (QUIC) header compression.

This library seeks to serve as a shared foundation for these and other 
applications, offering standardized, high-performance tools for encoding and 
decoding Huffman streams.
